### Prerequisite Knowledge

This is a great tutorial, it covers a lot of basic things.  You don't have to watch this all this week, but it will help you a lot throughout the course.

In this course we will be using Pytest to test our code. If you have never written a unit test or don't understand what
they are, you can read this article to explain the general idea.  [Unit Testing Basics](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)


## Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. Install GIT for your operating system.  **NOTE:  If you are a Windows user please also select to install GIT Bash during the installation process.** You can download GIT here: **[Download Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**

2. Install a version of Python that is equal to or greater than 3.9
installed. Please go here to download and install Python before continuing. **[Download Python Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

3. Signup for a students license for Pycharm Pro and Install it **[Signup Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)**, once you have signed up you will need to download and install Pycharm Pro **[from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**.  **DO NOT INSTALL THE COMMUNITY EDITION YOU NEED PYCHARM PRO!**

4. Open Pycharm Pro and clone the assignment repository.  Open up a terminal in Pycharm, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" and then run "pytest".  **If pycharm shows you an error about pip / requirements when you clone the repo just skip/cancel/dismiss the error and run the command in the terminal like i said above**   
5. You will see that the test fails because the code does not output the expected output.   You need to change the output of the program to pass the test and then submit the assignment for grading by pushing up to GitHub. To do this, you need to change the value in the test_with_pytest.py file.
6. When you your pytest passes just commit and push it back to the origin and the assignment will be automaticly graded by running the test that you run locally.
